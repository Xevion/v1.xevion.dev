# spotify-explicit

## About

The purpose of this repository/project is to capture my liked songs from my Spotify account, and then create a stacked bar graph representing my explicit vs "clean" songs.

Yes, the project is super simple and doesn't have that much usefulness, but it's the first time I've genuinely used `matplotlib` or `logger` in a serious context and it was definitely interesting.

## Demonstration
