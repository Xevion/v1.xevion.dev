# Xevion's Modpacks

Just a simple list of my modpacks, with a short description of my experience with it.

These are all the modpacks I know I've played as of now, which can go back maybe 2-4 years at most. Before that, I don't remember and I probably wasn't experiencing modpacks to their "fullest" back then.

## In-progress

### Enigmatica 2: Expert Mode

Mid-Late Game. In-progress.

### Antimatter Chemistry

Mid-Late Game. In-proress.

## Completed Modpacks

### Direwolf20 1.12.2

Basic modpack, nothing much to say. I experienced Refined Storage for the first time in this modpack. Good for beginners, I suppose.

### Direwolf20 1.10.2

One of my first modpacks ever. I don't remember anything beyond knowing I played it at some point.

### Infinity Evolved: Expert Mode

One of my favorite packs of all time. Beware, for you must learn TC4, IC2 and more. Microcrafting can get annoying, but I'm sure packs like GTNH have much harder microcrafting.

### Skyfactory 3

One of my first modpacks. I do not remember much about my playthrough then.


### Foolcraft 3

I don't know whether I should say I "completed" the pack, but I got as close as I could get before lag and everything else got to me. I was having issues with getting the creative crafting stuff to work properly, so I quit as the modpack was really simple.

I enjoyed my time with the first revamp of EnderIO for 1.12.2 here.

## Dropped

To preface this section, a lot of people drop modpacks, and I'm one who does this too, alot. The main reason is a lack of interest late game, and I don't consider me dropping something late game to be "finished", unfortunately. Lag, bugs and more become more prevalent as you play on, and they take away from the experience the farther you get in. I might be especially attractive to these issues as I tend to build large and complex bases, with lots of performance eating machines, entities and farms.

It's just how it is in Modded Minecraft. :-(

### Exoria

Too much microcrafting and magic for me. Not my cup of tea. I quit early.

### Forever Stranded: Lost Souls

I got rather lost somewhere while playing, I remember having FPS issues or something along those lines. I was rather unsure of what I was doing in the modpack and struggled to do anything without very closely watching Hypno's actions while playing.

### Stoneblock 1

This was a interesting playthrough, but honestly it followed the exact same tropes as something like Skyfactory, other than the fact that you have stone all around you, it seemeed to be almost no different.

I had lag, TPS issues especially, and quit after my friend left and the lag was getting to me. It felt like I had no reason to stay for a modpack like that.

Stoneblock 2 was not out at the time I played.

### Skyfactory 2.5

Pretty basic modpack, very similar to SF3 and honestly seemed pretty unguided with no quests, if I remember. I didn't know what was considered "complete" so when there was nothing really left to do, that's when I dropped the modpack.

### Project Ozone 2 : Kappa Mode (Revisit)

Dropped due to me having trouble with motivation to play, as I had gone through massive swaths of the modpack in a short time and needed a break.

I reset my computer at some point, and accidentally forgot to copy the Server folder (I copied the MultiMC instance, but not the Server Instance).

Great modpack, and I got insanely close to late-game (I had just created the second tier of EMC chests).


### Project Ozone 2 : Kappa Mode

Dropped due to lag troubles and a general late-game still. Still loved the pack and had much fun.


### Skyfactory 3 : Revisited

I tried to play this modpack again after a long time to see whether or not I really hated the modpack... I hated it. I still do.
