# Xevion.dev

**Archival Notice:** This repository was archived after prolonged inactivity by me. This site wasn't awful, it just wasn't effectively using the domain or resources allocated to it. Hosting a useless site is not productive and now I want to free the repository name up to be used by a GitHub Pages site via Jekyll. See said site repo [here](https://github.com/Xevion/xevion.dev).

## Purpose

The purpose of my site, [Xevion.dev](https://xevion.dev), is to display my site, learn Flask and other web development frameworks, and overall get some real experience.
I'll display my previous projects, as well as play with how Python and Flask work, using SQLite Databases and more.
I won't be putting up anything on there that I won't be putting on GitHub, as I want to put a separate repository on my profile and update both my site and my repository at the same time (maybe use some kind of crazy webhooks stuff to have them automatically update?).
