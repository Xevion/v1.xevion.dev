# Xevion.dev

## Purpose

The purpose of my site, [https://xevion.dev](https://xevion.dev), is to display my site, learn Flask and other web development frameworks, and overall get some real experience.
I'll display my previous projects, as well as play with how Python and Flask work, using SQLite Databases and more.
I won't be putting up anything on there that I won't be putting on GitHub, as I want to put a separate repository on my profile and update both my site and my repository at the same time (maybe use some kind of crazy webhooks stuff to have them automatically update?).
